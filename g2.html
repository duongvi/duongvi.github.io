			<h1>Hello G2!</h1>
			<p>I have made this site specifically for you in the hopes that since you have already come this far, you will at least consider me for a junior/trainee position. </p>

			<p>I have been a fan of G2 Esports as an organization for a while now (albeit not from the Gamers2 days but I remember and honestly - who WAS a fan at that point..), ever since you signed your first French CS:GO roster. When I saw the ad for a job that also aligns with my field of study, I could not pass up the opportunity of working for this great company. This would merge my hobby and study/work world together.</p>

			<p>I know that the position is looking for someone more experienced, but I would be willing and even thrilled to have a chance to start at an entry-level position at one of the best Esports organizations, as I have just finished my Bachelor studies in Computer Science at a university that ranks just as high in its field in Germany, even Europe - Technical University Munich. </p>

			<p>While you are at it, you can check out the projects that I undertook while I was learning the basics of web development. Please do keep in mind that <strong>this is not my peak yet</strong>, as I was mostly learning basics and programming in Java and a little bit of Python for data analysis at university and I am about as ready as one can get to learn new skills and knowledge required for the job and more! </p>

			<p>Lastly, I would like to sincerely thank you for reading through everything up until this point and I hope you can find a place in your company where I would fit in.</p>
